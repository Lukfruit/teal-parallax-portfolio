    description: "Customer segmentation analysis of 31M+ H&M transactions, uncovering that 5% of customers drive over a third of revenue using K-means clustering on 1.35M customers.",
    detailedDescription: `Analyzed 31+ million transactions from H&M's customer base spanning 2 years to uncover actionable insights for customer retention and revenue optimization.

    Using K-means clustering on 1.35 million customers, I identified 4 distinct behavioral segments — from young frequent buyers to high-value VIPs — revealing that just 5.3% of customers contribute 36.4% of total revenue.
    
    The analysis also uncovered a 65% one-time purchase rate, highlighting a major conversion opportunity, and identified 345k lapsed customers as a win-back target.`,
    challenges: "Working with 31M+ transaction records required careful data engineering to extract meaningful RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) features from raw purchase data while keeping processing efficient.",
    solutions: "Leveraged Python, Pandas, and Scikit-learn to build a scalable pipeline — from data cleaning through K-means clustering with silhouette analysis to determine the optimal number of segments.",
